# A pretty good testing pattern

Testing really isn't simple or easy. A lot of frameworks trick us into thinking
it is. That's great when they work, but can be very frustrating when they don't.
And if they have [1.5k open issues](https://github.com/facebook/jest) (at the
time of this writing), I personally find that it shakes my confidence and can
really put a dent in a workday.

I think there are a lot of good test runners out there. I've used a lot of them.
With Node's transition to ESM and syntaxes like JSX and Typescript, getting
everything configured perfect is still kinda tough sometimes.

### My preferred pattern atm

At low level, a test is essentially a Node script that makes some
assertions and exits `1` if any fail. So I've been trying to stay close to that.

```shell
node test.js
```

I've been using esbuild for
[building](https://github.com/sure-thing/presta/blob/main/packages/source-filesystem/package.json#L11)
my libraries, and [esbuild-register](https://github.com/egoist/esbuild-register)
makes it easy to keep the vanilla command line and still load **non-standard syntax.**

```shell
node -r esbuild-register test.ts
```

You probably also want a small library for **test suites** to help label, structure, and
assert your test suites. [uvu](https://github.com/lukeed/uvu) is currently my
pick. It's small, but has most of the ergonmics of much larger libraries.

**Coverage** is important, and luckily [c8](https://github.com/bcoe/c8) makes that a
breeze as well. Uploading and processing coverage is as easy as configuring the
[Coveralls GitHub
Action](https://github.com/coverallsapp/github-action#standard-example).

```shell
c8 -r lcov node -r esbuild-register test.ts
```

For **fixtures**, I've always liked [tap's
pattern](https://node-tap.org/docs/api/fixtures/). So recently I made my own
(very tiny) take on it, [afix](https://github.com/sure-thing/afix).

And **mocks**, the only thing I've found that works for everything is still
[proxyquire](https://github.com/thlorenz/proxyquire).

### Example

Here's the full test suite for [afix](https://github.com/sure-thing/afix).

```
import fs from 'fs'
import { test } from 'uvu'
import * as assert from 'uvu/assert'

import { afix } from '../'

test('afix', async () => {
  const fixture = afix({
    a: ['a.js', 'export default "foo"'],
  })

  assert.ok(fs.existsSync(fixture.files.a.path))

  fixture.cleanup()
})

test.run()
```

```shell
c8 -r lcov node -r esbuild-register lib/__tests__/index.ts
```

### Notes

Smaller libraries mean fewer bugs and faster more efficient runtime.
It can also mean lack of features, but the flexibility of combinging smaller
options like these means you get the features _and_ ultimate control.

It's a give and take but I think I'm finally pretty content with my testing
setup.
