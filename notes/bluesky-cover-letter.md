# Who I am and why

I'm originally from a very small town in Iowa. My parents are big DIY-ers, and
were happy to set me up with a workbench and tools from a young age. I liked to
tinker, taking apart RC cars and carving propellers from wood with a pocket
knife. That curiosity to independently explore lead me to pick up design and
dev late in college, and take a shot at applying to a web agency in NYC. I was
very fortunate, and things worked out.

Since then, I've worked with and helped found web agencies, freelanced in PHP
and Node, helped build a backend in Python, and continued to tinker on the side.
I enjoy building things, and I am happy spending most of my time busy with some
project or another. Lately this has been collecting and refurbishing bicycles,
but software is still my real passion.

My professional work and side projects have increasingly pulled me into the
depths of TypeScript, testing, and backend systems design. A good deal of my
work at my last two positions has been refactoring and leading the architecture
of frontend React and React Native codebases. But in the last 3-4 years, I've
spent a good deal of time in the backends of these codebases and with their
backend teams, and I've found solving problems at-scale and full-stack to be
what I'm most interested in. This has sent me exploring everything from
distributed systems to real-time socket communication, from embedded systems
programming to public key cryptography.

The internet is in a different place than when I started. I suppose older web
generations would say the same of the paradigm and socio-political shifts they
witnessed. I'm looking for a place to explore and build what's next, with
serious, inclusive people who want to make a real positive impact on our digital
lives. I think Bluesky might be the place.
