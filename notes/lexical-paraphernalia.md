# Lexical paraphernalia

**2021-12-26** — [source](https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/12/20/four-thousand-weeks-oliver-burkeman/)

_make meaning out of my borrowed stardust_

_finitudes_

"Enough is so vast a sweetness, I suppose it never occurs, only pathetic counterfeits." [Emily Dickinson](https://www.themarginalian.org/2018/12/10/emily-dickinson-love-letters-susan-gilbert/)

This all reminds me a lot of [The Tail End](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html).

_coping mechanism aimed at automating certain choices in order to allay the anxiety and time-cost of having to make them afresh each day_

"Any finite life... [is] a matter of ceaselessly waving goodbye to possibility[.]"

"How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives." [Annie Dillard](https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/06/07/annie-dillard-the-writing-life-1/)

"Of all ridiculous things the most ridiculous seems to me, to be busy." [Kierkegaard](https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/05/05/kierkegaard-on-presence-unhappiness/)

"And the life you will see incrementally taking shape, in the rearview mirror, will be one that meets the only definitive measure of what it means to have used your weeks well: not how many people you helped, or how much you got done; but that working within the limits of your moment in history, and your finite time and talents, you actually got around to doing — and made life more luminous for the rest of us by doing — whatever magnificent task or weird little thing it was that you came here for."

I need to read more Stoicism.
